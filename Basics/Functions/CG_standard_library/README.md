## CG standard functions (Intrinsic Functions, already implemented)

For details see the PDF document: [Nvidia's Cg reference manual, starting on page 685](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj5qpif6rHTAhXLF5QKHQ6MCeAQFggwMAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.download.nvidia.com%2Fcg%2FCg_3.1%2FCg-3.1_April2012_ReferenceManual.pdf&usg=AFQjCNHI5gaVpuvJH6ZO8bnX7BxJGKXr0A)  

### Limit values
   - **`clamp`** Clamps the specified value to the specified minimum and maximum range
   - **``** 
   - **``** 
   - **``** 


### Integer and floating-point manipulations:

   - **`abs`**  returns absolute value of scalars and vectors.  
   - **`ceil`** returns smallest integert (as a floating-point type) not less than a scalar or each vector component


### Trigonometric functions:
   - **`acos`**   returns arccosine of scalars and vectors.  
   - **`asin`**   returns arcsine of scalars and vectors. 
   - **`atan`**   returns arctangent of scalars and vector.
   - **`atan2`**  returns arctangent of scalars and vectors.
   - **cos``**    returns cosine of scalars and vectors.
   - **`cosh`**   returns hyperbolic cosine of scalars and vectors.
   - **``** 
   
   
### Checking multiple components of a variable:
   - **`all`** Problems reported (details unknown so far)  
      - It should be checked whether the function was used according to their specifications in these problem cases.
   - **`any`** Problems reported (details unknown so far)  
      - It should be checked whether the function was used according to their specifications in these problem cases.

#### Miscellaneous (function in Lightworks may be uncertain or untested):
   - `clip`  conditionally kill a pixel before output
   - `cross` returns the cross product of two three-component vectors
   - `ddx`   returns approximate partial derivative with respect to window-space X
   - `ddy`   returns approximate partial derivative with respect to window-space Y
